# Contributing

## Licensing of contributions

This project is **licensed under the GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 (`LICENSE`)**. By contributing you agree your contribution is licensed
under those same terms.


## Sign your commits — the DCO

Every commit must carry a `Signed-off-by` line:

```
Signed-off-by: Your Name <your.email@example.com>
```

`git commit -s` adds it for you. Set `user.name` and `user.email` first, because the
line has to be a real name you can be reached at.

**Why this exists, and why it is worth the friction.** A copyleft licence is only as good
as the project's right to ship the code under it. Without a record that each contributor
had the right to contribute and agreed to the terms, that right is assumed rather than
established — and if this ever needs relicensing, or a licence term needs enforcing, the
answer is every past contributor's permission individually. The sign-off is a per-commit
statement making that explicit, and it is far cheaper now than reconstructed later.

It is deliberately **not** a copyright-assignment CLA. You keep your copyright; nothing is
signed over to anybody. What the sign-off certifies is the [Developer Certificate of
Origin](https://developercertificate.org/), reproduced in full below.

## The gate

`cargo test --workspace` and `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets` must both be clean
before a change lands. A run that skipped clippy because the toolchain lacked it has
checked half the gate and should say so.
